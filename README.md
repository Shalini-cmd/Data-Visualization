# Data-Visualization
Often the stories data tell us can't be understood until visualized.
Many a times visualization has helped me explain my findings to finance teams & clients.
I have actively been involved in dashboarding in my job roles.
But due to data sensitivity issues, few of the data sources can't be accessed
