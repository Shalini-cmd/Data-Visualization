# Data-Visualization
Often the stories data tell us can't be understood until visualized.
Many a times visualization has helped me explain my findings to finance teams & clients.
I have actively been involved in dashboarding in my job roles.
But due to data sensitivity issues, few of the data sources can't be accessed

### As a part of our practicum collaboration under our Coursework, I worked on 2 major Tableau Workbooks:
- Performance Reporting :A/B test performance analysis, Tracking KPIs : Strategic Value, Unit Sales, Profit, Revenue across test stores, control stores and test vs control stores. Each dashboard give more detailed information about the experiments
- Diagnostic Analysis Report: Deep dive into performance at a product level across test and control stores. Detect worst performing categories based on different KPI measures. Click on a category to get redirected to products specifically driving/diminishing SQV.

### Data Narrative is a small Tableau individual project using an open source dataset on SF crime data & SF eviction data to apply different narration techniques
